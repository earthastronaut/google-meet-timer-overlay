# Google Meet Timer Plugin

This project is a Google Meet plugin designed to help users manage their time during meetings. It was also an experiment with ChatGPT to explore the capabilities and limitations of integrating AI with video conferencing tools.

## Features

- **Timer Display**: Shows a countdown timer to help keep track of meeting duration.
- **Notifications**: Alerts when the meeting is about to end or when a specified time limit is reached.

## Limitations

**Important Note**: This plugin cannot modify the outgoing video stream. This is a significant limitation that affects the ability to overlay the timer directly on the video feed.

    ```
3. Follow the setup instructions in the `INSTALL.md` file.

## Usage
